# ZigSteamController

Easy steam server management with a simple layer on top of steam-cli.

## Overview

The ZigSteamController Project aims to be a layer on top of the existing steam-cli. The Idea is to provide an advanced interface for managing your servers and eventually a GUI with it. Of course, as the name implies, the primary sweetener is the use of the Zig programming language as a multiplatform, superfast C-like language, since the tool is supposed to be run permanently in the background.
